# Stock Analysis
This project contains the stock analysis Excel workbook that Steve requested. It also includes the various VBA functions that are capable of processing daily stock results and combining them into a summarized analysis by year. Screenshots are also included to show refactored code performance.

## Overview of Project
We have been helping Steve by building various functions in VBA to perform stock analysis research for his parents. Throughout the module we have written code that is functional but that does not scale well when expanding the list of stocks significantly. The primary purpose of this project is to refactor to code to perform faster, describe the reasons for the performance gains, and dive into the code differences deeper and highlight additional pros and cons of the refactoring.
